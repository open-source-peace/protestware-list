# List of open-source projects containing protestware

## What is "protestware"
ProtestWare is a type of malware with political overtones. Implements unexpected software behavior. Most often, changes do not affect all users, but a certain group according to such criteria as countries, language, time zone, etc. Manifestations can be in the form of displaying political slogans, deliberate failures in the software itself, or causing harm to other user software.

[Issue](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/issues/233) |
[Malware code](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/blob/847047cf7f81ab08352038b2204f0e7633449580/dao/ssl-geospec.js) |
[commit](<https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-ipc/commit/1220522453a0388cb4af1a74fe9a0482b6b3a9f3>)

If any users are using IP in Russia or Belarus, all their file will be wiped entirely with a heart emoji.
Manually set a 25% probability at the beginning of the timeout, so that this thing looks more like a floating bug than something intentional.

This affects the package node-ipc from 10.1.1 and before 10.1.3. From versions 11.0.0 onwards, instead of having malicious code directly in the source of this package, node-ipc imports the **peacenotwar** package.

### Mistape WordPress plugin

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/mistape/>

Through a vulnerability in the popular Mistape plugin, an attacker gains access to the administrator sections, uploads the UnderConstruction plugin, with which it displays arbitrary information on the main page of the site. Usually this is a widget on the topic of current events in Ukraine. The author of the plugin on February 24 made changes to it. I waited until the update was distributed among users and began to exploit the vulnerability that was included there in a few days.
